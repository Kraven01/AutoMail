# AutoMail

AutoMail is a World of Warcraft addon designed to streamline the process of sending mail when attaching multiple items. This addon automatically sends a mail when the item limit is reached and reselects the recipient for the next batch of items.
Ideally if you need to send multiple items from one character to another.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Mail Sending**: Automatically sends the mail when more than 12 items are attached.
- **Recipient Reselection**: Automatically reselects the recipient for the next mail after sending.

## Installation

1. Download the addon and unzip it.
2. Place the `AutoMail` folder in your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` directory.
3. Restart WoW or reload the UI using `/reload`.

## Usage

1. Open your mailbox in World of Warcraft.
2. Select a recipient.
3. Attach items to the mail. When you add the 12th item, the mail will be sent automatically, and the recipient will be reselected for the next mail.

## Notes

- The addon assumes the recipient's name will remain the same across multiple mails. If you need to change the recipient, do so before attaching the items.
- The mail subject is automatically set to "AutoMail".
